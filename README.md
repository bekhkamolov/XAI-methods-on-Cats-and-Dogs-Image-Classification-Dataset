# XAI-methods-on-Cats-and-Dogs-Image-Classification-Dataset
In this project I applied 3 different Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods to obtain human interpretable explanations for the predition of a black-box model on the image dataset. 

## Dataset
[The Cats and Dogs Classification Dataset](https://xaidataset.github.io/dataset/#cats-and-dogs-classification-(cat&dog-xai)) used in the project is constructed from The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. As stated in the overview section, this binary classification dataset consists of 7390 images across 37 unique categories, each corresponding to different breeds of dogs or cats. Our XAI methods (LIME, Vanilla, GradCam) will try to explain the basis for classifying an image as either a dog or a cat.
